## You have to set a web server who should BE available on the VMâ€™s IP or an host (init.login.com for exemple). About the packages of your web server, you can choose between Nginx and Apache. You have to set a self-signed SSL on all of your services.

You have to set a self-signed SSL on all of your services

First, enable the SSL module of apache2 then reload the service
```
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo service apache2 reload
```
  
We now need to create a directory where we'll put our certificate and private key.
```
sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl
```

Then generate the certificate and private key  
-days *number of days the certificate will be valid*
-keyout *path to our generated key, here /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key*
-out *path to our generated certificate, here /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt*
  
```
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key -out /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
```
  
Protect our private key and certificate
```
sudo chmod 600 /etc/apache2/ssl/*
```

We are now going to create our own website configuration file
```
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
sudo touch epham.conf
```

And the folder in which our html pages will be
```
cd /var/www/html/     # Go to folder where all available websites html folders are
sudo mkdir epham      # Create a folder for our website
cd epham
mkdir html            # Create html folder of our website
cd html
sudo touch index.html # Create homepage file
```

Now that all our website's folders are created, we are going disable the default websites and enable ours to make sure it is the only *enabled* website (there should be 3 available websites, *000-default, default-ssl and epham*.
```
sudo a2ensite epham.conf  # Enable our website configuration file
sudo a2dissite            # Disable first default website
  000-default
sudo a2dissite            # Disable second default website
  default-ssl
sudo systemctl reload apache2 # Reload apache service
```
  
In our configuration file */etc/apache2/sites-available/epham.conf*
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName 10.12.1.140
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html/epham/html
	Redirect permanent /secure https://10.12.1.140
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    	SSLEngine On
    	SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
    	SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key

    	ServerAdmin epham@student.42.fr
    	ServerName 10.12.1.140
      	DocumentRoot /var/www/html/epham/html/
    	ErrorLog /var/www/html/epham/log/error.log
    	CustomLog /var/www/html/epham/log/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Reload the service
```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

Now, go to your browser, and type your address (https) : *https://10.12.1.140*  
  
Click on *advanced* and go to your page
  
If you click on *Not secure*, your should find the certificate you have created.
